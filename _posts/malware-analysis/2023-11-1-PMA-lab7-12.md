# Lab_7_1:


 ## 1. How does this program ensure that it continues running (achieves persistence) when the computer is restarted?

  first of all malware calls `StartServiceCtrlDispatcherA` and pushes to its service name `aMalservice`, this function is typically used in legitimate software development to create and manage Windows services. Services are long-running processes that can be started automatically when the system boots or on-demand and run independently of user interaction.

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic_7/auto_run.PNG)

## 2. Why does this program use a mutex?

 To check if the program and service is already run or not and if it's run the program will exit. 

 ![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic_7/mutex.PNG)

### Additional information:

###### What is the purpose of mutex?

  - **Synchronization:** Mutexes are often used in multithreaded or multi-process applications to provide synchronization and prevent multiple threads or processes from accessing a shared resource concurrently. This ensures that only one thread or process can access the protected resource at a time, preventing data corruption and ensuring orderly execution.

  - **Resource Access Control:** Mutexes are used to control access to shared resources, such as files, memory, or hardware devices, to avoid conflicts when multiple components or instances of a program need access to the same resource.

  - **Critical Sections:** Mutexes are used to create critical sections within code, allowing only one thread to execute a specific code block at a time. This can be important for managing shared data structures and avoiding race conditions.

  - **Preventing Deadlocks:** In complex programs with multiple threads or processes, mutexes are used to prevent deadlocks, where two or more components are waiting for each other to release a resource. By acquiring and releasing mutexes in a specific order, you can prevent deadlocks.

  - **Safeguarding Initialization:** Mutexes can be used to ensure that a resource or component is initialized only once, preventing multiple threads or processes from reinitializing it concurrently.

  - **Task Synchronization:** In some cases, mutexes are used to synchronize tasks in a program, ensuring that tasks are executed in a particular order or that specific tasks wait for others to complete before proceeding.

## 3. What is a good host-based signature to use for detecting this program?

 call `StartServiceCtrlDispatcherA` and push to it service name `aMalservice` that can be started automatically when the system boots or on-demand and run independently of user interaction and checking for `HGL345` service.

## 4. What is a good network-based signature for detecting this malware?

create thread with start address `loc_40116D` that use **Internet Explorer 8.0** to go `http://www.malwareanalysisbook.com`.

 ![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic_7/network_indicator.PNG)

## 5. What is the purpose of this program?

 - malware checks if a mutex called **HGL345** was created and if it malware exit, if not malware creates a new one and opens the service manager by calling `OpenSCManagerA`, after that the malware create a service called **Malservice** and then changing file timestamps by calling `SystemTimeToFileTime`.

 - After that, the malware creates a thread with the start address `loc_40116D` in an infinity loop that uses **Internet Explorer 8.0** to go `http://www.malwareanalysisbook.com`.

 ## 6. When will this program finish executing? 

 the program never finishes because the thread created in a non-conditional loop that's never ends


# Lab_7_2:


## 1. How does this program achieve persistence?

After analyzing the program it shows not achieving persistence.

## 2. What is the purpose of this program?

the program called `OleInitialize` to create a COM object.

 ![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic_7/com_obj.PNG)

Based on that the program creates an object which is then passed execution of the string: `http://www.malwareanalysisbook.com/ad.html`

 ![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic_7/url.PNG)


After the run, we can assume that the COM object initialized is Internet Explorer and push the URL to it.

 ![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic_7/expl.PNG)

###### Additional Information:

  - OleInitialize is a function used in Microsoft's Component Object Model (COM) for initializing the COM library. The COM library is a fundamental framework for building and using software components in a Windows environment. 

  - It provides a way for different software components to communicate and interact with each other, regardless of whether they were developed by the same or different authors.

  - OleInitialize is typically called at the beginning of a program to set up the COM runtime environment, It initializes various COM subsystems, allowing the program to create, manage, and use COM objects

## 3. When will this program finish executing?

After it launches Internet Explorer and opens a webpage or fails. 


# Lab_7_3.exe:

## 1. How does this program achieve persistence to ensure that it continues running when the computer is restarted?

  - At first look, we can't see any obvious evidence of persistence but the program loads malicious dlls `Kernel32.dll`, `Lab07-03.dll`.

   ![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic_7/load_dll.PNG)

  - `MapViewOfFile` is used in conjunction with `CreateFileMappingA` to map a view of a file into a process's address space. This functions is commonly used for memory-mapped file operations in Windows applications and allows a process to access and manipulate the contents of a file as if it were a block of memory

  - Some malware may use file mappings as a persistence mechanism, allowing them to stay resident in memory even after the system reboots.
 
  #### By looking at Lab7_3.dll:

  - the library checks if there mutex called **SADFHUHF** and if not it will be created.

   ![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic_7/mutex_dll.PNG)
   
  - **C2** function used to send a socket in IP `127.26.152.13` and create anuther process.

     ![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic_7/ip_address.PNG)

     ![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic_7/cr_proc.PNG)



## 2. What are two good host-based signatures for this malware?

 - File: kerne132.dll , Lab07-03.dll
 - Mutex: SADFHUHF 
 - **C2** function used to send a socket in IP `127.26.152.13` and create anuther process.

## 3. What is the purpose of this program?

 - Lab_7_3.exe
    Copies **Lab07-03.dll** to **kerne132.dll** and look for the .exe file and load into RAM by calling `MapViewOfFile` and `CreateFileMappingA` and import tables from **kerne132.dll**
 
 - The DLL:

    DLL checks mutex: `SADFHUHF` and creates socket `127.26.152.13:80/TCP` and tries to connect to the server by sending `hello` then sleep `6 minutes` or executing `Create Process`

    ![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic_7/purpose.PNG)




## 4. How could you remove this malware once it is installed?

It's very difficult to remove it, you can remove `kerne132.dll` but it may be used in every process and cause a crash on system, rebuild your system easily or restore from backup :)

# Lab 9_3:

## 1. What DLLs are imported by Lab09-03.exe?
  
  by first look in **Dependency walker** I founf 4 DLL but by looking into **KERNEL32.dll** that's show `LoadLibraryA` so I guess it's load some DLLs in runtime.

  ![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic_7/dlls.PNG)
  statcly by using **Dependency walker** I found:
  - DLL1.dll
  - DLL2.dll
  - KERNEL32.dll
  - NETAPI32.dll 

  ![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic_7/cmd_proc.PNG)

  - user32.dll 
  
  ![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic_7/dll3.PNG)
  ![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic_7/user_dll.PNG)

## 2. What is the base address requested by DLL1.dll, DLL2.dll, and DLL3.dll?
   
   By using Pe-bear we are able to see there image base:
   - DLL 1: `10000000`
   - DLL 2: `10000000`
   - DLL 3: `10000000`
  ![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic_7/base_image.PNG)


## 3. When you use OllyDbg to debug Lab09-03.exe, what is the assigned based address for: DLL1.dll, DLL2.dll, and DLL3.dll?

  By using **OllyDbg** we can see by click in botton **alt + m** the memory map for program that is show the image based address:

  - DLL1.dll: `10000000`
  - DLL2.dll: `004B0000`
  - DLL3.dll: `00A50000`
  ![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic_7/run_image.PNG)
